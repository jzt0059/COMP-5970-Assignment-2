    <H1>Cooking</H1>

    <H5>Origin</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        I learned to cook at an early age. It started my mom giving me small tasks to help with cooking such as prepping things for meals. I learned to cook on the stove first and then I began to learn to make dishes in the oven. Cooking was a consistent activity that I participated in throughout the years.

    <H5>My First Dish</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        My first cooking meal started with breakfast. I learned how to scramble eggs, cook bacon, and make grits. 

    <H5>Take Your Time</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        One thing I learned early about cooking is that it is important to take your time. It  may seem convenient to cook your dishes on high heat, but it actually could create a negative effect on your dish. It can affect the impact of your flavor as well as the texture of your dishes.

    <H1>Cooking Failures</H1>

    <H5>Lack of Focus = Burned Results</h5>
    <p style="color: red">
       When cooking, it is important to be focused on your dish. There are down times in cooking, but you must be aware of the time. Once I started a dish and I forgot to lower my stove temp. In the process I dozed off and overslept, which resulted to a burnt dish.  
    </p>

    <H5>Baking</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        When I began to learn to bake, I mainly baked savory dishes such as casseroles and pasta dishes. I haven't really created any desserts in my baking journey, except for a sweet potato pie. It was pretty decent for my first attempt.
    </p>
    <H5>Motivation When Cooking</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        When cooking my motivation for taste, is if it tastes like how my family makes their dishes, then I look for ways to make the dish my own.
