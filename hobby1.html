    <H1>Swimming</H1>

    <H5>Origin</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        I have been swimming since I was about 7 years old. I remember taking swimming lessons where we were instructed to kick. I kicked, and I was told to see the coach after the lesson. I thought I was in trouble or that I had done something wrong, but in reality, the coach was interested in me joining the rec's swim team. I never got to pursue it due to my young age, but I have always wondered, "What if I actually got to pursue this?" I have always loved being in the water!

    <H5>45 Minutes Explained</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        I have a daily goal set on my Apple Watch to be active for at least 45 minutes a day. When I first started swimming at the Aquatics Center, I only used to swim for 30 minutes a day. Swimming, to me, doesn’t feel like exercise, so I began to notice that I wanted more time in the water and that I wasn’t feeling extreme exhaustion after a 30-minute swim. I also began to realize that I wanted to swim for a longer distance. So, I recently increased my swim time to 45 minutes, and I have not had an ounce of regret.

        I love to swim. I try to start each day with a 45-minute swim at the Aquatics Center. It brings me a sense of calmness and peace.

    <H1>Lessons Learned</H1>

    <H5>Water Temperature Matters</h5>
    <p style="color: red">
        One thing I have learned while swimming is that the temperature of the water really affects your swim. For instance, if the water is too cold, it slows you down as your body is trying to warm up. This causes my movements to be a bit more stiff. When the water is warmer, I notice that I can swim and move a lot faster.

    <H5>Equipment Helps</H5>
    <p style="color: red">
        While swimming, I have also learned that equipment such as goggles and a swim cap really increases performance. I wear glasses, so my eyes are very sensitive in the water without goggles. I find myself more focused on the burning sensation in my eyes rather than the swim itself. With goggles, I can clearly see as I tread water, and I don’t have to worry about eye discomfort.

    <p style="color: red">
         I also learned that a swimming cap helps with treading water and reducing friction with the water. Without the swim cap, my hair starts to absorb the water, and my head begins to feel heavy.
